  abstract = {The epidemic of mass mortality of oak trees by Japanese oak wilt has affected secondary deciduous broadleaved forests that have been used as coppices in Japan. The dieback of oak trees formed gaps in the crown that would be expected to enhance the regeneration of shade-intolerant pioneer species. However, foraging by sika deer
              Cervus nippon
              has also affected forest vegetation, and the compound effects of both on forest regeneration should be considered when they simultaneously occur. A field study was conducted in Kyôto City, Japan to investigate how these compound effects affected the vegetation of the understory layer of these forests. The presence/absence of seedlings and saplings was observed for 200 quadrats sized 5 m ×5 m for each species in 1992, before the mass mortality and deer encroachment, and in 2014 after these effects. A hierarchical Bayesian model was constructed to explain the occurrence, survival, and colonization of each species with their responses to the gaps that were created, expanded, or affected by the mass mortality of
              Quercus serrata
              trees. The species that occurred most frequently in 1992,
              Eurya japonica
              ,
              Quercus glauca
              , and
              Cleyera japonica
              , also had the highest survival probabilities. Deer-unpalatable species such as
              Symplocos prunifolia
              and
              Triadica sebifera
              had higher colonization rates in the gaps, while the deer-palatable species
              Aucuba japonica
              had the smallest survival probability. The gaps thus promoted the colonization of deer-unpalatable plant species such as
              Symplocos prunifolia
              and
              Triadica sebifera
              . In the future, such deer-unpalatable species may dominate gaps that were created, expanded, or affected by the mass mortality of oak trees.},
